Hello, my name is Siloa Willis. I am a Doctoral student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests inculde plate tectonics and metamorphism, geoscience education, and best practices for producing GeoEd videos/animations.

I teach the lab section of Stratigraphy and Sedimentology, an upper level course for geoscience majors. I also teach Geoscience Animations, which is an upper level elective designed to give geoscience students the opportunity to explore science communication on digital platforms. Students will conduct a small scale research project on a geoscience topic and then create a video/animation to explain their topic to a general audience. Students will learn basic video editing skills as well as keyframe animation (using Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects).

### More Information

Outside of my research I enjoy rock climbing, yoga, hiking, and painting.
