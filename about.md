Hello, my name is Siloa Willis. I am a Doctoral student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests inculde plate tectonics and metamorphism, geoscience education, and best practices for GeoEd videos/animations.

I teach the lab section of Stratigraphy and Sedimentology. I also teach a course called Geoscience Animations, which is an upper level elective which gives students the opportunity to research a geoscience topic of their choosing, and then turn their research paper into a video/aniamtion. Students will learn basice video editing skills as well as keyframe animation. Being able to present scientific topics to broader audiences is an increasingly important skill, this class aims to give students some technical skills to do that.  

### More Information

Outside of my research I enjoy rock climbing, yoga, hiking, and painting.
