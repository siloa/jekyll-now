## Field Work
#### June 2019 I traveled to Moab, Utah to assist in collecting spectral data on clay gouge as well as physical samples to ship back to UT Dallas for further analysis.

Check out the samples from the lab course I teach on my [website](https://labs.utdallas.edu/geosamples). All photos by me!

#### Geocience Animations
I teach a course on video editing and keyframe animation for geoscience majors interested in exploring best practices for sharing scientific knowledge in a digital world.
